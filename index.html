       <h3 class="post-title">A Real Mind-Blender</h3>
       <div class="post-content">
         <p>So, I've basically just started dabbling in a couple different design areas. First, I tried my hand at designing a simple video-game in Unity, and while that was pretty good fun...I kind of lost steam at that point because I wasn't too sure how to progress. Second, I decided to make this website! I'm pretty happy with it so far, even though I know it's fairly amateur-looking. I know I can just keep improving it over time, and tinkering with it - so I'm content to let it tick over for now. </p>
         <p>The final thing I started working on this weekend is something called Blender. Many of you have probably heard of it already, but just in case, I have included a link to the website below. Blender is essentially, as far as I understand it, an open-source piece of software...which is really pretty powerful. I'm a video-editor in my spare time, and have been interested in digital design since I started using a computer, so the possibilities that Blender holds excite me quite a bit. After...well, most of the day today to be honest, I finally had something I was happy to post here: my treasure chest!</p>
         <p><img src="chest_test_1.png" width="480" height="270"></p>
         <p>Again, it's basic, it's amateur, and I used a tutorial to guide me along, but I'm hoping it's the first in a series of things I can put together to further my understanding of the program. If any of you want to check out Blender, I would highly reccommend it - even for people who have never tackled 3D modelling before. Just follow this <a href="https://www.blender.org/">link</a> to download the program, and then check out YouTube to find amazing tutorials from some awesome people. Until next time!</p>

         <p>If somebody would have told me a week ago that I would be

             on a real blog!</p>
