       <h3 class="post-title">So..It's been a while, eh?</h3>
       <div class="post-content">
         <p>Hey everyone...*cough*. What can I say? Life gets in the way sometimes, and that's just the way it is. I hope you've all been fantastic, and carrying on with whatever lights a fire inside you. </p>
         <p>As for myself, I've mostly been working. My day job is a pretty weird one, and it has its ups and downs. I work as something called a Science Communicator, which basically means that I chat about science to the public. Great job right? Well, yes...sometimes. Sometimes it downright sucks. But I think that's something that you can say about every single job out there, right?</p>
         <p>The things that make me struggle with my job sometimes is actually just stupid stuff that gets in the way, shouldn't, but always does: bureaucracy; people getting involved in things that shouldn't concern them...you know - the usual.</p>
         <p>To be more specific, what I do is write educational shows (performed on-stage), build things called "outreach boxes", and generally put together content, always based upon STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects - then teach it to other science communicators, who then use that information to engage the public! It's a brilliant job, and I really love it. When I get to do it.</p>
         <p>I've even been in the newspaper and on television talking about science communication, and how others can get involved in the field. But...every time I've done that, I've always felt so false. I sometimes don't know if I'd do it all the same way if I went back and had another chance. And considering the trouble I've had convincing myself to stay in this field, it feels a little disingenuous to encourage others to jump into the mire.</p>
         <p>To tell the truth, I don't really know what the point of this post is. It's half an apology, and half a moaning session for me. But I think everyone needs that every now and then. And this is somewhere I can complain to a blank space, where nobody is listening - but someone could be...and I quite like that.</p>
         <p>Anyway, anonymously unknown, potentially non-existant reader - thanks. Thanks for reading this, if you did. I hope you have a fantastic day, and maybe I'll write you again.</p>
         <p>Love, Kickartist.</p>

       <h3 class="post-title">A Real Mind-Blender</h3>
       <div class="post-content">
         <p>So, I've basically just started dabbling in a couple different design areas. First, I tried my hand at designing a simple video-game in Unity, and while that was pretty good fun...I kind of lost steam at that point because I wasn't too sure how to progress. Second, I decided to make this website! I'm pretty happy with it so far, even though I know it's fairly amateur-looking. I know I can just keep improving it over time, and tinkering with it - so I'm content to let it tick over for now. </p>
         <p>The final thing I started working on this weekend is something called Blender. Many of you have probably heard of it already, but just in case, I have included a link to the website below. Blender is essentially, as far as I understand it, an open-source piece of software...which is really pretty powerful. I'm a video-editor in my spare time, and have been interested in digital design since I started using a computer, so the possibilities that Blender holds excite me quite a bit. After...well, most of the day today to be honest, I finally had something I was happy to post here: my treasure chest!</p>
         <p><img src="chest_test_1.png" width="480" height="270"></p>
         <p>Again, it's basic, it's amateur, and I used a tutorial to guide me along, but I'm hoping it's the first in a series of things I can put together to further my understanding of the program. If any of you want to check out Blender, I would highly reccommend it - even for people who have never tackled 3D modelling before. Just follow this <a href="https://www.blender.org/">link</a> to download the program, and then check out YouTube to find amazing tutorials from some awesome people. Until next time!</p>

         <p>If somebody would have told me a week ago that I would be
           be able to make a website, I would <strong>not</strong>
           have believed them.</p>

             on a real blog!</p>
